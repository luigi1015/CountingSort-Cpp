CountingSort-Cpp
================

This small C++ project implements a version of Counting Sort.

To use the code you should include CountingSort.cpp and call CountingSort::countingSort( std::vector<T> input, std::vector<T> &output, T highest). The countingSort function takes 3 parameters, the input elements, the output elements, and the highest element of the input.

Class T is assumed to be an unsigned integer-like variable.
